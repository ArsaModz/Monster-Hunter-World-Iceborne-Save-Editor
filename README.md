# Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Save Editor (PS4/PC)
A save editor for *Monster Hunter World: Iceborne* on PS4 and PC. Rewritten from the ground up in C# and WPF (.NET 4.7.2), this tool offers a comprehensive suite for managing character progression, inventory, equipment, and more across multiple save slots on both platforms.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📂 Multi-Slot Management
The editor automatically detects and supports up to **three independent save slots** found in a standard MHW save file.
* **Platform Detection:** Automatically identifies whether the save file is from PS4 or PC and handles decryption/encryption accordingly.
* **Slot Selection:** Easily switch between different characters in the same save file.
* **Safety First:** Automatically generates a `.bak` backup of your save file before any write operation.
* **Quick Access:** Open your PC save folder or MHW game folder directly from the editor. Automatically detects your Steam account — prompts you to choose if multiple accounts are found.

A full suite of tools for managing your character slots:
* **Copy Slot:** Duplicate any slot to another with a live preview of both before committing (shows Hunter Name, Gender, HR, MR, Zenny, Research Points, and Playtime).
* **Export Slot:** Save any character slot to a `.mhwslot` file — automatically named after your hunter for easy identification.
* **Import Slot:** Load a `.mhwslot` file into any destination slot.
* **Cross-Platform:** Exported `.mhwslot` files are platform-agnostic — a slot exported from a PS4 save can be imported into a PC save and vice versa, with a confirmation prompt before writing.
* PS4 extra-block is preserved on all copy, export, and import operations to prevent data corruption.
